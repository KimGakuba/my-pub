# ðŸ’§ Efficient Water Use in Agriculture: A Key to Sustainability

# FAOSTAT Agriculture Dashboard

My Power BI dashboard provides comprehensive insights into global agricultural land use and water management, helping stakeholders evaluate efficiency and vulnerability in water-scarce areas. The dashboard analyzes data from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) to track agricultural trends and resource utilization patterns.

## Dashboard Overview

### Water Efficiency Challenge
This opening page presents key performance indicators for global agricultural land utilization. It displays critical metrics including the total irrigated agriculture area (8.36 units), land equipped for irrigation infrastructure (422.79 units), and total cropland area (79.97K units). The page includes interactive filters for year range selection and unit preferences, enabling users to customize their analysis timeframe and measurement units.

### Trends in Irrigated Agriculture Over Time
The trends analysis page features dual line charts that visualize the evolution of agricultural metrics across different time periods. The left chart shows the sum of values by year, while the right chart displays sum of values by area code over time. These visualizations reveal growth patterns, seasonal variations, and long-term trends in agricultural development, helping identify periods of significant change or stable growth.

### Executive Dashboard Overview
The final page serves as an executive summary combining multiple visualization types in a single comprehensive view. It features trend lines, bar charts, pie charts, and key performance indicators (433.93K and 12.83K metrics) along with comparative analysis (-705.68). This integrated dashboard provides decision-makers with a complete picture of agricultural performance, enabling quick assessment of overall trends and identification of areas requiring immediate attention.

# Agriculture Data Analysis Project

This project performs comprehensive data analysis on agricultural datasets, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to understand agricultural trends and patterns.

## Dataset Overview

The project works with an agricultural dataset containing 1,675 entries across 15 columns, including:
- **Domain Code & Domain**: Land use classifications
- **Area Code & Area**: Geographic regions (primarily Rwanda)
- **Element Code & Element**: Measurement types
- **Item Code & Item**: Agricultural items/products
- **Year Code & Year**: Time period (1961-2022)
- **Unit**: Measurement units
- **Value**: Quantitative measurements
- **Flag & Flag Description**: Data quality indicators

## Data Preprocessing

### Missing Value Analysis
The initial analysis revealed missing values across multiple columns:
- Most columns had 0 missing values after initial cleaning
- **Note** column had 1,675 missing values (completely empty)
- Applied threshold-based filtering to remove columns with >50% missing values

### Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Missing Value Imputation**: Numerical columns were imputed using median values
2. **Outlier Detection**: Applied statistical methods to identify and handle outliers
3. **Data Type Optimization**: Separated numerical and categorical columns for appropriate processing
