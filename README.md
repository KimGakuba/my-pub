Project Overview
The core of this project involves transforming raw Uber trip data into meaningful visualizations and reports. The analysis covers aspects such as fare amounts, pickup/dropoff locations, passenger counts, and time-based trends.

Data Source
The primary data source for this analysis is a dataset containing detailed Uber trip information. The uber_fares_dashboard.pbix file is the Power BI Desktop file that contains the data model, queries, and reports.

Key Analysis Areas & Visualizations
The Power BI report is structured into several pages, each focusing on different aspects of the data:

1. Data Overview
This section provides a glimpse into the raw data structure and its basic statistics, helping to understand the initial state of the dataset.

2. Data Information and Types
This page details the data types and non-null counts of each column, which is crucial for data quality assessment and understanding the dataset's completeness.
